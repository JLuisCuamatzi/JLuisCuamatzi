- 👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Luis Cuamatzi Flores
- 👀 I’m interested in biotechnology, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how a genome has an adaptation to adverse environments in a eukaryotic model
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics projects that involve the identification of novel mutations.
